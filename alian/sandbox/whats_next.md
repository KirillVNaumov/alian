# to do

- analysis.py 
  - remove the not needed code (superseeded by jet_analysis.py)
  - AnalysisEngine - remove
- data_io.py
  - AnalysisEngine should go to a separate file
    - change AnalysisEnging to EventLoop?
  - implement event cuts here?
- pythia_io.py
  - implement data source with pythia
  - use .cmnd file to initialize pythia
- jet_analysis.py
  - implement embedding analysis - pythia into data:
    - add another source to steeting code; set data as driver; + just needs analysis handing two sources
    - in principle no need to run jet finding on pythia alone separately within this analysis... could be done in the steering code
  - write a jet tree (constituents) - in python? with uproot? c++ code?
- more analyses
  - single particle spectrum (jet constituents)
  - EEC's
  - E3C's
  - angularity
  - jet-axis
  - theta_g
  - lund diagram x EEC
  - FF
  - do we need separate things for p-Pb?
  - implement data source for D's analysis in run2 data
  - EEC of D's
